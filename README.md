# Alarm_Python
The "Alarm Clock" project is a simple Python program that allows users to set an alarm time and receive a notification when the alarm time is reached. Users can set the desired alarm time in HH:MM format through a drop-down menu. The users can also optionally add a comment to be displayed alongside the alarm notification. When the user presses a button, the alarm is set. Once the alarm time matches the current time, the alarm displays the specified comment and emits a beep sound. After the alarm goes off, the user can snooze it multiple times as desired. This alarm clock provides a convenient and customizable way for users to manage their time and receive reminders.
